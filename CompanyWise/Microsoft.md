* [Count number of distinct elements of size k](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-distinct-elements-in-every-window/1)

* Given an array of numbers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array. The subsequence does not necessarily have to be contiguous. For example, given the array [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15], the longest increasing subsequence has length 6: it is 0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15.

* You have an N by N board. Write a function that, given N, returns the number of possible arrangements of the board where N queens can be placed on the board without threatening each other, i.e. no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

* Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.
